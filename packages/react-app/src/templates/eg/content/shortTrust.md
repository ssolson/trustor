1. Preface
   1. This is an express _inter vivos_ trust (i.e., revocable living trust), created this **_trustCreationDate_**, the terms of which are wholly expressed in this instrument, except for those incorporated by reference.
   1. The form of delivery of this trust instrument is known as a “smart contract,” which digitally instantiates the terms of this trust instrument for global implementation across all digital and cyber networks, platforms, and systems, which serves to enable the administration of property subject to this trust that is of either digital, physical, or of mixed nature, regardless of medium or media wherein the trust property manifests existence.
   1. This trust incorporates by reference all programming language, or code, appurtenant to the smart contract carrier of this trust instrument.
   1. The Grantor of this trust is **grantorName** (herein, “Grantor”).
   1. The Initial Trustee of this trust is **initialTrusteeName** (herein, “Initial Trustee”).
   1. Grantor intends for this trust to be valid under the laws of **jurisdiction** and any state or jurisdiction wherein this trust is administered.
   1. The terms of this trust prevail and override all default provisions of the laws of the situs jurisdiction and the laws of any other state which may have jurisdiction over this trust; mandatory provisions that cannot be waived shall apply to this trust.
   1. The terms and provisions of this trust instrument that are expressed as programming language or code contained in the digital smart contract and that are incorporated by reference herein shall supplement the provisions of this trust instrument that are expressed in English language form; the Initial and Successor Trustee shall be directed by all the provisions, in whatever form, of this trust instrument for purposes of administering the trust and this trust instrument.
   1. For purposes of executing this trust, Grantor transfers **_[X consideration]_** to Initial Trustee.
   1. All property or assets, regardless of kind, form, or nature shall be accepted by the Initial Trustee and any Successor Trustee now and at any time hereafter.
   1. The terms of this trust instrument govern all aspects of retention, administration, and disposition of trust property for the benefit of Grantor, as initial beneficiary, and for the remainder beneficiaries of this trust.
2. Article One
   1. For purposes of identification, this trust is referred to as **trustName**.
   2. Grantor reserves the power to act on behalf of this trust without limitation, and may amend, restate, or revoke this trust at any time, for any purpose, in whole or in part by republication of this trust in writing, whether expressed digitally or otherwise, and irrespective of the form of language used for the purposes described in this section.
   3. Grantor may add or remove trust property at any time and for any purpose; Grantor retains fully the unrestricted right to direct and control the distribution of income and principal of the trust, up to and including exhausting all the trust property for the Grantor’s benefit.
3. Article Two
   1. The provisions governing Trusteeship, including Trustee succession, shall be as follows:
      1. Grantor may remove any Trustee for any reason at any time that Grantor is alive and not incapacitated.
      2. If Grantor is incapacitated or deceased, the following, in this order, shall serve as Successor Trustee **successorTrusteeNames**.
      3. A Successor Trustee shall be deemed to have failed to serve if the Successor Trustee is unable or unwilling to meet the criteria for acceptance, which are as follows: **[What Trustee do be verified]**
      4. Upon the death of the Grantor, the successor beneficiaries of income or principal of this trust may remove a Successor Trustee for cause only, only by petitioning a court of competent jurisdiction for removal.
      5. A Successor Trustee that has been removed must be replaced within 30 days of removal by an Independent Trustee who qualifies as such under Section 672(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of the United States.
      6. Notice of Successor Trustee removal and subsequent replacement by an Independent Trustee must be in writing, published along with this trust in the form of an amendment, and must state the date of removal.
      7. All powers of any Successor Trustee or Independent Trustee acting on behalf of this trust shall be conferred in a fiduciary capacity.
4. Article Three
   1. While the Grantor is alive and not incapacitated, the Grantor shall be the sole income and principal beneficiary of this trust.
   2. If Grantor is Incapacitated, trust property shall be distributed directly or indirectly or to any part or entity involved in providing for the care, support, maintenance, and welfare of the Grantor, in keeping with the standard of living in which the Grantor is reasonably accustomed, and with respect to economic reality as a function of the anticipated costs of Grantor’s needs over time and the totality of trust property.
   3. Upon the death of Grantor, the remainder beneficiaries of this trust shall be identified as follows: **beneficiaryNames**.
   4. As soon as practicable after the death of Grantor, Successor Trustee to the Grantor shall administer the property of this trust for the beneficiaries as follows: 8. **beneficiaryNameShares**, outright and free of trust. 9. If the Successor Trustee is directed under the terms and provisions of this trust to distribute trust property to a minor who has not attained the age of 18, the Successor Trustee may distribute such property either directly to the legal guardian or Personal Representative of the beneficiary or retain the property in trust until the minor child attains the age of 18, upon which time the trust property shall be distributed to the beneficiary, outright and free of trust. 10. If the Successor Trustee retains trust property in continuing trust for a minor beneficiary, the Trustee is authorized to distribute trust income and principal for the beneficiary’s health, education, maintenance, and support as the Trustee determines necessary or advisable; any undistributed income generated by trust property shall be added to trust principal.
   5. If a beneficiary predeceases the Grantor, the beneficiary’s share shall be distributed **[_pro rata_ to the other beneficiaries designated in this trust; or \_per stirpes/per capita \_to the descendants of the beneficiary (these are generally the only options, unless it is to charity)**].
5. Article Four
   1. If the Successor Trustee verifies with absolute certainty that** [all the beneficiaries are deceased—with or without descendants depending on Grantor’s selection—or that none of the charitable beneficiaries specified in Article Two are in existence] then the Successor Trustee shall distribute all remaining trust property to [intestacy? Charity? Other people? This might seem extraneous, but we can’t have an undefined value in the event of a default of beneficiary designation; the technical term for this provision is the Remote Contingent Distribution, but I prefer to market it more palatably as the “Doomsday Provision” or “The Rapture,” for those who in the South]**.
6. Article Five
   1. This trust shall be administered without judicial supervision, intervention, order, or action; this trust shall be subject to the jurisdiction of any court unless a Successor Trustee or beneficiary subjects this trust to the jurisdiction of a court by initiating a legal proceeding.
   2. To the extent allowed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which this trust is sited during the life of the Grantor or subsequently administered, no Trustee, including the Initial Trustee or Successor Trustee, shall be required to give any bond, surety, security, inventory, accounting, or appraisal to any court, at any time; moreover, no Trustee shall be required to serve with bond or surety at any time that this trust is in effect.
   3. No Trustee shall be liable for any action, or failure to act, with respect to any provision of this trust, or with respect to any matter or event related to this trust, so long as the action or inaction is made in good faith and in a manner reasonably consistent with the experience and sophistication of the then-serving Trustee with respect to matters involving trust administration.
   4. At any time and for any reason the Trustee of this trust may delegate the right to exercise any power granted to the Trustee under the terms of trust instrument to another named Trustee, or to an Independent Trustee or corporate fiduciary; delegation may be made in any form of written or electronic communication.
   5. In accordance with the mandatory provisions of the laws of the jurisdiction to which this trust is subject, if any power of the Trustee is delegated to another Trustee, the delegating Trustee shall make a reasonable effort to inform the beneficiaries of the delegation, whether in writing or verbally, as appropriate; failure of the delegating Trustee to effectively communicate the delegation to the beneficiaries shall not subject the delegating Trustee to liability and shall constitute harmless error.
   6. A Successor Trustee shall not be responsible for any action, inaction, mistake, forbearance, or omission of any prior Trustee; any Successor Trustee shall be released and indemnified from any liability arising from the conduct of the Trustee if made in good faith and in a manner reasonably consistent with the experience and sophistication of the Trustee with respect to matters involving trust administration.
   7. Except for the Grantor, any Successor Trustee, including an Independent Trustee or corporate fiduciary, who is serving as Successor Trustee under the terms of this trust instrument or pursuant to delegation by the then-serving Successor Trustee, is entitled, but not required, to fair and reasonable compensation for the services provided as a fiduciary, and may be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in carrying out the duties of the Trustee under this trust instrument; an Independent Trustee or corporate fiduciary providing Trustee services may be compensated per agreement executed by either the Successor Trustee or the beneficiaries, but consent of the beneficiaries shall not be required.
   8. A Successor Trustee, including an Independent Trustee or corporate fiduciary who is acting under delegation of or who has been appointed to serve by the Successor Trustee, may charge additional fees for services provided that are beyond the scope of the duties provided in this trust instrument, including fees for legal services, tax preparation, asset management, custodial services, or other finance or banking services.
   9. Grantor shall never be required to provide reports or accountings of any kind to any Successor Trustee or beneficiary; the Successor Trustee, or Independent Trustee or corporate fiduciary providing Trustee services, is not required to provide any reports or accountings to any beneficiary, except as required by the laws of the jurisdiction in which this trust is administered.
   10. Notwithstanding the terms of Section 5.9, the Successor Trustee, or Independent Trustee or corporate fiduciary providing Trustee services, may satisfy the jurisdictional requirement to provide a report to a beneficiary by providing a copy of the federal income tax return associated with this trust for the year of the return, if filed; otherwise, the legal requirement to provide a beneficiary with a report or accounting of the trust shall be satisfied if the beneficiary waives the right to said report or accounting, or may satisfy the legal requirement as long as the beneficiary of the trust is provided sufficient information regarding the administration of the trust to protect the beneficiary’s interest in the trust.
7. Article Six
   1. A Trustee may exercise all the powers conferred by this instrument without approval from any court or other entity, and may take any action reasonably necessary to administer this trust estate in accordance with the terms of this instrument.
   2. A Trustee may exercise any powers conferred by the law of the situs jurisdiction or of any jurisdiction in which this trust is administered, including common law or statutory powers, such as the trust code of the relevant jurisdiction, subject to any limitations or contrary directions contained herein.
   3. A Trustee must exercise these powers in furtherance of the beneficiaries’ right to beneficial enjoyment of the trust property and in a manner consistent with the general principles of the law of trusts; a Trustee may have additional duties in addition to those described in this trust instrument that are legally binding, and the Trustee shall make a good-faith effort to accomplish other legal duties and responsibilities.
8. Article Seven
   1. This trust is subject to a spendthrift provision. Therefore, no interest of any beneficiary of the income and principal of this trust, or of any trust created hereunder, shall be subject to the claims or interference or control of the beneficiary’s creditors, or others, or be liable or subject to attachment or execution, or to any bankruptcy proceedings, or any other legal process or law, nor shall the beneficiary be able to hypothecate, assign, anticipate, encumber, or alienate his or her interest in any income or principal of this trust or any trust created under this trust; a creditor cannot compel any Trustee to make a discretionary transfer to a beneficiary. Where the Trustee is also a beneficiary, restraint on transfer is invalid against transferees or creditors of the Grantor. This Section in no case shall restrict a beneficiary’s right to disclaim any interest or exercise any power of appointment granted in this trust.
   2. The right of a person to take any interest provided to him or her under this trust, or provided in any any trust created under this trust instrument, will be administered as if the person predeceased the Grantor without leaving any living descendants if that person, alone or in conjunction with any other person, including legal counsel, engages in directly, or participates in indirectly, any of the following actions:
      1. Any contest(s) of the validity of this trust by a claim of undue influence, duress, lack of testamentary capacity, or fraud, or in any capacity objects in any court to the validity of this trust, or any trust created under the terms of this trust instrument, or of any other testamentary device that I have created, including any other revocable or irrevocable trusts, Grantor’s Will, beneficiary designation on any account, insurance policy, retirement plan, annuity, or payable-on-death or transfer-on-death designation filed with any organization, so long as they are signed by me either in writing or digitally, or any amendment or restatement to this trust or to any of the other aforementioned documents, devices, and designations.
      2. Any attempt to obtain adjudication in any court proceeding in any jurisdiction that the trust (or this trust instrument, in addition to any documents, devices, or designations of the kind described in Article Seven, Section 7.2.1, above) is void, or otherwise seeks to void, nullify, or set aside the the trust or any of its provisions, or any of the over documents, devices, or designations referred to in this section.
      3. Any attempt to file or filing of suit on a creditor’s claim filed in a probate of Grantor’s estate, against the trust estate, after the Trustee or other respective fiduciary has rejected the claim or otherwise taken no action with respect to the claim.
      4. Any filing of a petition or other pleading to change the character (e.g., with respect to separate, joint, real, personal, tangible, intangible, community, etc.) of property already property characterized by the trust or this trust instrument.
      5. Any filing of a petition to impose a resulting or constructive trust on any assets of the trust estate.
      6. Any participation in any of the activities mentioned above in this Article Seven, Sections 7.2.1-7.2.5, or in any other activity or action that is undertaken in a manner that is clearly or reasonably adverse to the trust estate, such as conspiring with or assisting any person who takes or partakes or in any of the aforementioned actions, or any others designed to limit, alter, or defeat the application of this trust as expressed throughout the terms of this trust instrument.
   3. The Trustee may defend any violation of Section 7.2 or of any of the subsections contained therein at the expense of the trust estate.
      1. A mediation proceeding not preceded by a filing of a contest with a court shall not trigger the provisions of Section 7.2.
      2. Any arbitration proceeding, whether preceded by a filing of a contest with a court or not, shall be sufficient to trigger the provisions of Section 7.2
   4. The Grantor’s intention for the application of the provisions of this Article Seven, Section 7.2 and subsections thereunder, and Section 7.3, above, is that they shall apply to actions that clearly or reasonably relate to challenges to the dispositive provisions of the trust and this trust instrument, and not to reasonable questions related to the administration of the trust or to the manner or frequency of trust distributions. However, any question regarding the administration of the trust that constitutes a “veiled” challenge (i.e., one which subjects this trust to the jurisdiction of a court, or would otherwise serve to impermissibly challenge the dispositive provisions of this trust as described throughout this Article Seven), or that is raised with such frequency or in such a manner that a reasonable Trustee would feel harassed or threatened by such action or activities, will constitute a challenge to the trust that is subject to the punitive provisions set forth in Section 7.2 of this Article Seven.
   5. In the event that any person, including a beneficiary, does contest any dispositive provision of this trust as contemplated in Section 7.2 and subsequent sections of this Article Seven, such person shall be advised by the Trustee (by any form of written transmission, whether by mail, email, text message, or other electronic or analogue or non-electronic method of transmission whereby written or typed messages are sent and received) and shall have 7 days to provide written or automated acknowledgment of receipt to the Trustee, who shall, from the time of notification and subsequent receipt of acknowledgment, or from the expiration of the 7-day notice period if no acknowledgment is provided and a reasonable attempt to contact the person by alternative means of communication has been made by the Trustee, provide the person with 21 days (calculated as total days, not business days) to withdraw the contest without penalty under this Article Seven.
   6. Disclaimer by any person shall not permit that person to receive trust property free of trust at a time earlier than provided by the terms of this trust. Any attempt to accomplish this by partial or total disclaimer shall result in the disclaimed trust property remaining in trust, to be administered for and distributed to such disclaiming beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of this trust instrument which would have governed in the absence of the disclaimer.
   7. **_If any person, party, or entity–whether human or electronic–that is related to this trust or implicated directly or indirectly by the dispositive terms of this trust instrument, or if any unrelated or outside person, party, or entity–whether human or electronic (including but not limited to any third-party person, entity, script, program, interface, application, device, process, or machine)–that is not implicated directly or indirectly by the dispositive terms of this trust instrument, performs any transaction, action, activity, or other conduct or behavior that affects the administration of this trust in any manner, regardless of the materiality of the action and irrespective of the intended or actual outcome thereof, then the result shall be that the Trustee shall immediately and without prejudice take any and all actions necessary to prosecute the offending person, party, or entity to the fullest extent available under the laws of the jurisdiction selected by the Trustee wherein the Trustee may avail itself of swift and determinative justice by a court of competent jurisdiction in the form of civil and criminal penalties, in addition to any other equitable and legal remedies available to the Trustee_**.
      1. Pursuant to the above, performance of any of the following transactions, actions, activities, conduct or behavior described in this Section 7.7.1, whether performed singly or in conjunction, and regardless of time, reason (if any is proffered), manner, or method of execution, shall always constitute an impermissible and unlawful attack on this trust and this trust instrument, which shall be punishable to the fullest extent of the law as provided in Section 7.7, above: Reentrancy; Oracle Manipulation; Frontrunning; Timestamp Dependence; Insecure Arithmetic Integer Overflow and Underflows; Denial of Service; “Griefing Attacks”; Force Feeding; Deprecated/Historical Compiler Issues; as well as any other known or unknown type, form, or function of attack designed to prevent, interrupt, degrade, corrupt, or otherwise compromise the effectiveness or performance of the smart contract or other digital device or medium the function of which is either directly or indirectly required for, or related to, the operation or administration of this trust or this trust instrument. This section shall be in force and in effect at all times from the earliest moment of conception of this trust and of the creation and establishment of this trust instrument and related smart contract or other digital means or media by which this trust instrument is expressed, and at all relevant times during the administrative period of this trust by the Grantor, or by the Trustee, and until the final action by the Trustee that serves to conclude the administration of the trust pursuant to the dispositive terms of this trust instrument.
   8. If any beneficiary who is surviving at the time of Grantor’s death dies within 5 calendar days after Grantor’s death, then the beneficiary will be considered to have predeceased Grantor for the purposes of this trust.
   9. At any time, the Trustee may change the governing law of the trust; change the \_situs \_of the administration of the trust; and remove all or any part of the property from one jurisdiction to the other. The Trustee may elect, by filing an instrument with the trust records, in any written or electronic form, that the trust will then be construed, regulated, and governed by the new jurisdiction’s laws. The principal purpose for the relocation of the trust’s \_situs \_shall be the minimization of taxes in respect of the trust or of any trust beneficiary; additionally, if the Trustee determines that it is necessary or advisable, in the sole and absolute discretion of the Trustee, to conduct the administration of the trust under the laws of another jurisdiction, then the Trustee shall have the unrestricted authority to relocate the situs of this trust to the jurisdiction deemed appropriate or proper by the Trustee.
   10. The Trustee, in its sole and absolute discretion, and at any time and for any reason, may appoint an Independent Trustee to commence to serve immediately as the Trustee of the trust, or upon such time as specified in the Trustee’s appointment, notwithstanding the fact that the appointment may result in the relocation of the \_situs \_of the trust by virtue of the appointment itself or by decision of the Independent Trustee, if deemed necessary or advisable in the Independent Trustee’s sole and absolute discretion.
   11. This trust and this trust instrument shall incorporate by reference all of the provisions of the Uniform Law Commission’s (ULC) Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (UFADAA) (2014) or the revised version of the UFADAA—known as the Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act, Revised (2015)—depending on which version has been adopted by the jurisdiction wherein this trust is administered, or of any subsequent jurisdiction having jurisdiction over this trust’s administration.
       1. If the state, commonwealth, or United States Territory having jurisdiction over the administration of this trust has not enacted laws addressing fiduciary access to digital accounts and assets, or if the Trustee, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines that the administration of this trust is best served by the application of the provisions of an alternative jurisdiction, and the Trustee files an instrument with the trust records, in any written or electronic form to that effect, then the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes, Nev. Rev. Stat. § 143.18 and Nev. Rev. Stat. § 722.010 _et seq._, shall be incorporated by reference into this trust and shall be controlling on the Trustee in regards to the administration of this trust and the dispositive terms of this trust instrument.
