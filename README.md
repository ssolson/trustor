###📦 install 📚

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ssolson/stealth_trustor.git
cd stealth_trustor
git checkout -b feature_branch
yarn install
```

---

### Checkpoint 1: 🔭 Environment 📺

You'll have three terminals up for:

`yarn chain` (hardhat backend)

`yarn start` (react app frontend)

`yarn deploy` (to compile, deploy, and publish your contracts to the frontend)

> 👀 Visit your frontend at http://localhost:3000

> 👩‍💻 Rerun `yarn deploy --reset` whenever you want to deploy new contracts to the frontend.

> ignore any warnings, we'll get to that...

### 💾 Deploy it! 🛰

📡 Edit the `defaultNetwork` in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.js`, as well as `targetNetwork` in `packages/react-app/src/App.jsx`, to [your choice of public EVM networks](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/)

👩‍🚀 You will want to run `yarn account` to see if you have a **deployer address**.

🔐 If you don't have one, run `yarn generate` to create a mnemonic and save it locally for deploying.

🛰 Use a faucet like [faucet.paradigm.xyz](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/) to fund your **deployer address** (run `yarn account` again to view balances)

> 🚀 Run `yarn deploy` to deploy to your public network of choice (😅 wherever you can get ⛽️ gas)

🔬 Inspect the block explorer for the network you deployed to... make sure your contract is there.

---
### Checkpoint 6: 🚢 Ship it! 🚁

📦 Run `yarn build` to package up your frontend.

💽 Upload your app to surge with `yarn surge` (you could also `yarn s3` or maybe even `yarn ipfs`?)

>  😬 Windows users beware!  You may have to change the surge code in `packages/react-app/package.json` to just `"surge": "surge ./build",`

⚙ If you get a permissions error `yarn surge` again until you get a unique URL, or customize it in the command line.

🚔 Traffic to your url might break the [Infura](https://infura.io/) rate limit, edit your key: `constants.js` in `packages/react-app/src`.

---
### Checkpoint 7: 📜 Contract Verification

Update the `api-key` in `packages/hardhat/package.json`. You can get your key [here](https://etherscan.io/myapikey).

> Now you are ready to run the `yarn verify --network your_network` command to verify your contracts on etherscan 🛰

👀 You may see an address for both YouToken and Vendor.  You will want the Vendor address.

👉 This will be the URL you submit to 🏃‍♀️[SpeedRunEthereum.com](https://speedrunethereum.com).
